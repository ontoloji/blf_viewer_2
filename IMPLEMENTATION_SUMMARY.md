### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.7+**: Core language
- **PyQt5**: GUI framework
- **python-can**: BLF file reading
- **cantools**: DBC file parsing
- **pyqtgraph**: High-performance plotting
- **numpy**: Numerical data handling
- **matplotlib**: Additional plotting support

## User Interface Components

### Menu Bar
- **File Menu**:
  - Open BLF File (Ctrl+B)
  - Open DBC File (Ctrl+D)
  - Save Workspace (Ctrl+S)
  - Load Workspace (Ctrl+L)
  - Export Graphs (Ctrl+E)
  - Exit (Ctrl+Q)

- **View Menu**:
  - Reset Zoom (Ctrl+R)
  - Fit to Data (Ctrl+F)

- **Help Menu**:
  - User Guide (F1)
  - About

### Layout

- **Right Panel (75% width)**: 5 synchronized graphs
- **Status Bar**: File information and statistics
- **Resizable**: Splitter between panels for adjustable layout

## Key Algorithms

### BLF Processing
1. Load BLF file using python-can.BLFReader
2. Extract all CAN messages with timestamps
3. Normalize timestamps to start from 0
4. Cache messages by arbitration ID

### DBC Parsing
1. Load DBC file using cantools
2. Extract message and signal definitions
3. Create lookup tables for message IDs
4. Provide decode functionality

### Signal Processing
1. Match BLF message IDs with DBC definitions
2. Decode raw CAN data using DBC signal definitions
3. Extract time-series data (timestamp, value pairs)
4. Convert to numpy arrays for efficient plotting
5. Cache processed signals to avoid reprocessing

### Graph Synchronization
1. Create 5 PlotWidget instances
2. Link all plots to first plot's X-axis using setXLink()
3. All zoom/pan operations automatically synchronized
4. Independent Y-axis for each signal

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid BLF file format
- Invalid DBC file format
- File not found errors
- DBC-BLF message ID mismatches
- Exceeding maximum signal selection (5)
- Export failures
- Workspace load/save errors

All errors are presented to users with clear, actionable messages via QMessageBox dialogs.

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: BLF files processed on-demand
2. **Caching**: Decoded signals cached to avoid reprocessing
3. **NumPy Arrays**: Efficient numerical data storage
4. **PyQtGraph**: Hardware-accelerated plotting
5. **Selective Processing**: Only selected signals are decoded
